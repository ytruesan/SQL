#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT count(orderID) 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
    
#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT count(orderID) 
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
    AND Product = 'iPhone';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT a.acctnum
    FROM BIT_DB.customers AS a
    JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS b
    ON a.order_id = b.orderID;

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT Product, price
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    ORDER BY price ASC
    LIMIT 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product, SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
    GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    ORDER BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct a.acctnum), AVG(b.Quantity*b.price)
    FROM BIT_DB.customers AS a
    JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS b
    ON a.order_id=b.orderID
    WHERE Quantity>2
    AND length(orderID) = 6 
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID';
