SELECT product, SUM(quantity), SUM(Quantity)*price AS Revenue
    FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
    WHERE location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    ORDER BY product;

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(distinct a.acctnum), AVG(b.Quantity*b.price)
    FROM BIT_DB.customers AS a
    JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS b

    WHERE Quantity>2
    AND length(orderID) = 6 
    AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

#8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

#12. What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?
SELECT SUM(Feb.Quantity)/COUNT(customers.acctnum) AS avg_purchased
    FROM BIT_DB.customers AS customers
